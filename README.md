- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Validation:** Zod
- **Architecture:** Repository Pattern with SOLID Principles
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Deployment:** AWS EC2

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:


 **Docker**
   - To build and run the containerized app
   - [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Steps to Run Locally Using Docker

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
https://github.com/muhammed-mashood-alungal/Nalanda.git
cd Nalanda
```
#### 2. Create Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root:
```bash
NODE_ENV=development
JWT_ACCESS_KEY=<your_sercret>
JWT_REFRESH_KEY=<your_refresh_sercret>
MONGO_URI=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>
PORT=9000
```
#### 3. Build the Docker Image
Create a .env file in the project root:
```bash
docker build -t nalanda-api .
```
#### 4. Run the App in Docker
```bash
docker run -p 9000:9000 --env-file .env nalanda-api
```


### Alternative: Run Without Docker

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 20+ and MongoDB must be installed locally.

If you prefer to run the app locally without Docker:
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create .env file (same as above)

# Run in development mode
npm run dev

# Or build and run in production mode
npm run build
npm start
```
